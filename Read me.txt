Overview
This project processes and validates weather data. The main script, kunskappython, takes data from a CSV file and saves it into a SQL Server database called WeatherDB. To ensure everything works correctly, there’s a test script called testpython that checks the main script’s functions and the data quality. The project also uses logging to keep track of both the data processing and testing activities.

Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
Install the necessary Python packages using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install pyodbc pandas
Make sure to have SQL Server installed and accessible. Create a database named WeatherDB.
Usage
Place the CSV file containing weather data in the specified directory (e.g., C:\Users\Imthias\Downloads\archive\weather_data.csv).
Run the main script to process the data:
bash
Copy code
python kunskappython.py
Run the test script to validate the functionality:
bash
Copy code
python testpython.py
Scripts
Main Script: kunskappython.py
Purpose: insert weather data from a CSV file into the WeatherDB database, validates the data, and logs the process.
Functionality:
Loads data from the specified CSV file.
Renames columns for consistency.
Checks for the existence of the WeatherData table and creates it if necessary.
Inserts data into the database.
Logs errors and successful operations.
Test Script: testpython.py
Purpose: Validates the functionality of the main script and checks the integrity of the data in the database.
Functionality:
Connects to the WeatherDB database.
Checks the number of records in the WeatherData table.
Validates the presence of DateTime values.
Computes the average temperature from the data.
Logs the results and any errors encountered.
Log Files
Process Log: process.log

Logs the outcomes of the data processing, including errors and successful data loads.
Test Log: test.log

Logs the results of the validation tests, including the number of records, null checks, and average temperature.
Database Schema
The WeatherDB database contains the following table:

Table: WeatherData
Column Name	Data Type
DateTime	DATETIME
Temp_C	FLOAT
DewPointTemp_C	FLOAT
RelHum_Percent	FLOAT
WindSpeed_km_h	FLOAT
Visibility_km	FLOAT
Press_kPa	FLOAT
Weather	VARCHAR
Task Scheduler
Windows
Open Task Scheduler.
Create a Basic Task named Run KunskapPython Script.
Set the trigger and action to run kunskappython.py using your Python interpreter.
